Used cursor, for initial project setup. Below are the key changes and fixed by cursor.

- It used customer name for order creation. Issues with this approach:
    - Not unique: multiple customers can share a name
    - No customer identification: can't track a customer's order history
    - Not scalable: can't query orders by customer efficiently
    - No customer entity: no profile or relationship

- Used HTTP by default without confirmation, for better performance used GRPC

- Used InMemory by default, updated it to Database backed

- Did not have audit columns in entities for MySQL. Got it added by prompts

Got the code review done by windsurf. Below are the issues reported and fixed by windsurf

- No indexes.
    - DB migration script added for creating indexes with flyway migration

- No connection pooling and batch processing support.
    - Added.

- Pagination
    - Added

- N+1 Query Issue
    - Fixed

- Input validations & global exception handler

- Use separate DTOs for API and domain models
    - Fixed. This took considerable time as it could not figure out OrderStatus of API and domain model.

- Implement Circuit breaker and bulk head
    - TBD

- There were errors related to flyway migration and column entity mapping where multiple iterations are required to fix the issue
